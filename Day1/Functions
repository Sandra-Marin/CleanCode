Review 1- Violation of SRP. Initialization of session should not happen inside password checking method. 
Review 2- Name should not be globally declared. Name is getting updated inside the function. it should not do that.
Review 3- The method name IsDOMNodeNotPresent creates a double negative.If node can be null or empty, consider handling it inside the method to prevent unexpected behavior.
Review 4-Incorrect String Comparison (Char Instead of String). _type is uninitialized and could be null, leading to a runtime exception.
Missing default Case
Review 5- Avoid Using GetType() for Type Checking.The usage of as can return null if the cast fails. It is better to check the result of the as cast to avoid NullReferenceException.
Return Missing.
Review 6- Avoid Repetitive String Concatenation. While default arguments like temp = false are fine, itâ€™s better to separate concerns by having a dedicated method for creating temporary files. 
This improves clarity.
Ensure Path Exists (if temp is true). If the "./temp/" directory does not exist, an error will occur. It might be helpful to create the directory if it doesn't exist.
Unclear Method Name (Touch). The method name Touch is not very descriptive. It would be clearer to name it something like CreateFileIfNotExists or CreateOrUpdateFile.
Review 7- Review8: The method GetInstance() does not specify a return type should be changed to  public static GetInstance() to public static DBConnection GetInstance(). 
If multiple threads access GetInstance() simultaneously, multiple instances may be created.
_instance should be readonly if using Lazy<T> for thread safety. The constructor should remain private to prevent instantiation outside the class.
Review 8- Use Named Parameters for Readability in Calls. Consider Using an Object for Parameter Grouping, Default Values for Optional Parameters.
